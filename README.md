# AdventOfCode

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

In this repo, I will upload all my solutions to the problems I attempt. The directories will be seperated by days and years.
